### Hey there, I'm Brad! 👋
Interested in all things technology!   
Most of my experience is in Full Stack software development, but I am mainly interested in backend development and cybersecurity.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments
- 🌱 I’m currently learning penetration testing and offensive security
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been playing the drums for over 10 years! 🥁
